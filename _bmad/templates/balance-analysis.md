## 2. Metrics Analysis

### 2.1 Simulation Setup
```
Games: {N}
Players: {Player types}
Cards analyzed: {List}
```

### 2.2 Results

#### Per-Card Metrics
| Card | Pick Rate | Win Corr | Evo Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| {Card 1} | {X}% | {X}% | {X}% | {Notes} |
| {Card 2} | {X}% | {X}% | {X}% | {Notes} |

#### Family Metrics
| Family | Win Rate | Pick Rate | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| {Family 1} | {X}% | {X}% | {Notes} |

#### Class Metrics
| Class | Win Rate | Pick Rate | Notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| {Class 1} | {X}% | {X}% | {Notes} |

### 2.3 Outliers

**Overpowered (>60% win correlation or >80% pick rate)**
- {Card/mechanic}: {Metric} = {Value}

**Underpowered (<40% win correlation or <20% pick rate)**
- {Card/mechanic}: {Metric} = {Value}

## 3. Change Proposal

### 3.1 Proposed Changes

#### Change 1: {Card/Rule Name}
| Attribute | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| {Stat} | {Value} | {Value} | {Why} |

#### Change 2: {Card/Rule Name}
| Attribute | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| {Stat} | {Value} | {Value} | {Why} |

### 3.2 Expected Impact
| Metric | Before | Expected After | Confidence |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| {Metric} | {Value} | {Value} | High/Med/Low |

## 4. Validation Plan

### 4.1 Simulation Tests
```bash
# Run balance simulation with proposed changes
uv run python scripts/run_balance_sim.py \
    --config configs/balance/proposed_changes.yaml \
    --games 10000
```

### 4.2 Success Criteria
- [ ] {Card} pick rate within 20-80%
- [ ] {Card} win correlation within 40-60%
- [ ] No new outliers created

## 5. Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Overcorrection | Medium | Medium | Start conservative |
| New imbalance | Low | High | Run extensive sims |
