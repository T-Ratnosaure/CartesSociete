# QC Remarks - Pending Client Review

These issues were identified during quality control review and require client input before fixing.

## Resolved Issues

### ~~1. Cyborg Level 1 Attack Values = 0~~
**Status**: RESOLVED - Intentional design
**Client response**: "Les cyborg ont 0 atq avant de lvl up!" (Cyborgs have 0 ATQ before leveling up)

### ~~3. Liche Inferieur Level 1 Wrong Class Abilities~~
**Status**: FIXED
**Client response**: "La liche elle est 1/1 jme suis gourré" (The Liche is 1/1, I made a mistake)
**Fix applied**: Changed stats to 1 HP / 1 ATQ and fixed class abilities to Mage abilities

## Still Pending

### 2. Missing Hall of Win Momie Level 1
**File**: `hall_of_win.json`
**Problem**: `hall_of_win_momie_2` exists but `hall_of_win_momie_1` does not
**Question for client**: Should we add Momie level 1? If yes, what are the stats?
- Suggested stats based on patterns: ~3 HP, ~3-4 ATQ, movement: 1

---

### 4. Lapinflexible Wrong Class Abilities
**File**: `lapin.json`
**Cards**: `lapin_lapinflexible_1` and `lapin_lapinflexible_2`
**Problem**: Card has `card_class: "Defenseur"` but has Archer class abilities (+4 dgt si 2 defenseurs)
**Should have**: Defenseur class abilities (+2 PV pour les defenseurs)
**Question for client**: Confirm this is a copy-paste error to fix?

---

### 5. Cyborg Level 2 Wrong Family Abilities
**File**: `cyborg.json`
**Problem**: Most level 2 Cyborg cards have "+4 pv a la fin du tour" instead of the Cyborg invocation mechanic
**Affected cards**:
- `cyborg_steamtrooper_2`
- `cyborg_lolo_le_gorille_2`
- `cyborg_cyberaccoon_2`
- `cyborg_cyber_phoenix_2`
- `cyborg_cyberours_2`
- `cyborg_cyberpique_2`
- `cyborg_naingenieur_2`

**Expected** (Cyborg invocation):
```json
"family_abilities": {
  "scaling": [
    {"threshold": 3, "effect": "invoque hydre steam"},
    {"threshold": 6, "effect": "Invoque dragon steam"}
  ]
}
```
**Question for client**: Should level 2 Cyborgs keep the invocation mechanic?

---

### 6. Lapin Missing Combattant Class
**Problem**: Lapin is the only major family without a Combattant class card
**Question for client**: Is this intentional, or should a Lapin Combattant be added?
